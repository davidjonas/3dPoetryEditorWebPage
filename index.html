        <h3>What is 3D Poetry Editor?</h3>
        <p class="col3">
        3D Poetry Editor is a text editor for composing poems in three dimensions,
        using three-dimensional structures, and can also be used to read and distribute
        three-dimensional poems.
        3D Poetry Editor allows writers to compose poems in a virtual three-dimensional
        space. 3D Poetry Editor adds depth to the two dimensions on which lines of written
        poetry are usually positioned. Writing in this space and connecting words, lines or
        complete stanzas creates a three-dimensional structure that enables reading in
        multiple directions. The reader can navigate the three-dimensional space, read the
        poem, and explore its spatial construction.

        <h3>Poetry in Three Dimensions</h3>
        <p class="col3">
        How does poetry function in three dimensions? What are the formal, structural,
        rhetoric, stylistic and poetic possibilities offered by writing in three dimensions?
        How does the working process unfold if you can position words in a three-dimensional space,
        and see the three-dimensional structure take shape while
        writing? What kinds of poems are produced? And how are they different from poems
        that are written in two dimensions? Will it result in new ways of thinking about
        poetry?
        <br />
        <br />
        For many poets the page is a 'field of composition', a two dimensional space for
        words that can be read in different directions. Especially in the digital realm this led
        to experiments with non-linear and multi-dimensional reading that hint at three-dimensionality.
        Composing poetry in three dimensions does offer a new dynamic
        'text field' in which new, unforeseen meanings can appear. The flexible, changeable
        space of words and sentences enables a multi-sequential way of reading, and
        emphasises space over time. This changes how readers explore a poem and make
        sense of it.
        </p>

        <span class="quote">
        "Using 3D Poetry Editor, I wrote couplets that explore wave-particle duality and
        associated issues in particle physics, poetry, and philosophy. The poem draws from
        my ongoing investigative work in quantum poetics, a theory and practice I use that
        applies principles in theoretical physics to poetry in order to explore how physical
        reality is assumed, imagined, and tested through language at discernible and
        indiscernible scales of spacetime."
        <span class="by">Amy Catanzano</span>
        </span>

        <h3>Writing 3D Poetry</h3>
        <p class="col3">
        In 3D Poetry Editor the writer builds three-dimensional poetic structures by writing
        and connecting words or lines of poetry - the nodes that create networks or other
        structures. Three different forces affect the nodes in the virtual space. These forces
        function as compositional tools, and are somewhat similar to the fundamental forces
        in our universe.
                <span class="quote">
                  "It was like collaborating with an invisible partner, who was more dancer and weaver
                  than poet, and who would not tell me in advance what he might do next!"
                  <span class="by">Sampurna Chattarji</span>
                </span>
        To ensure that the poem does not expand out of control, a gravity
        centre pulls all the nodes towards the middle of the space. Individual nodes repel
        each other: they only use their own space and do not overlap with others. When the
        nodes are connected, they are brought together and pull at each other. These three
        forces act upon each other, and create a dynamic three-dimensional constellation.
        They decide how the poem will behave in the three-dimensional space, and
        determine its organisation. As they do not directly control every detail, poets have to
        allow for unexpected effects and constructions. They have to find other ways of
        relating subject matter and form, of creating a poetic effect.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading 3D Poetry</h3>
        <p class="col3">
        The reader of a 3D-poem can navigate the virtual space in a way similar to a 3D
        computer game, zooming in on details, or zooming out to see the entire structure.
        The lines and words are suspended in the virtual space; large words are nearby, small
        ones far away.
        Some poems look like a mobile, or a three-dimensional representation
        of molecules, while others resemble a constellation of stars. And sometimes reading a
        poem is like travelling through space and watching words fly by. Any node can be
        grabbed, and dragged through the space. Pulling on a piece of the poem reveals how
        that piece is connected to others, and allows for a positioning of the lines for easier
        reading. This changes the visual representation of the poem, but not the topology of
        the network.

                        <span class="quote">
                          "Senses are born on the crossings of any lines."
                          <span class="by">Maria Malinovskaya</span>
                        </span>

        Because the nodes are governed by three forces, which position them in
        space and in relation to each other, there is in most cases no fixed or preferred
        reading order. The poem itself is a site for discovery. Reading a 3D-poem also means
        engaging with a fluid form, or exploring to reveal the underlying structure.
        </p>

        <span class="quote">
        "The beauty of it lies in the fact that it forces you to really think about every line you
        write. You can&#39;t depend on the sequence as it normally is on paper or spoken out
        loud, so every line has to be attractive, exciting, wrongheaded or whatever enough to
        keep the reader tempted. Time is of no importance anymore, because there is no
        beginning or end. The reader determines how he reads the poem and when he or she
        is done with it."
        <span class="by">Daniel Dee</span>
        </span>

        <h3>What has been written until now?</h3>
        <p class="col3">
        Amy Catanzano, Adam Dickinson, Sampurna Chattarji, Maria Malinovskaya, Derek Beaulieu, Morten S&oslash;ndergaard, Mani Rao, Nils Christian Moe-Repstad, Laura Accerboni, Angela Rawlings, Jan Baeke, Jon St&aring;le Ritland, Daniel Dee, and Mamta Sagar have used 3D Poetry Editor to create poems. Their poems suggest different formal and compositional possibilities that can be explored in three dimensions. Some meticulously built networks or structures &ndash; simple or complex &ndash; that corresponded to the subject matter of their poems. For example, in Diamond Jon Stale Ritland mimics the atomic structure of a carbon atom by creating four connections to every node of the poem. Others played with the structural possibilities, allowing the reader reveal the construction through interacting with the poem. The couplets of Amy Catanzano&rsquo;s Wavicles tie two lines together, foregrounding the dual nature of light and matter as both waves and particles; there is a play of text sizes and overlapping movements, but no linear progression, no beginning or end. Some poets saw working with 3D Poetry Editor as a way to escape the confines of the static page, and embraced the dynamic form and the loosening of authorial control, gaining in the process a fresh perspective on the process of writing. Derek Beaulieu let all the lines from an English translation of Mallarm&eacute;&rsquo;s Un Coup de D&eacute;s explode in the virtual space, creating a whirling tension of recombinant text.
      </p>

        <h3>The History of 3D Poetry Editor</h3>
        <p class="col3">
        3D Poetry Editor evolved from BodySearches/PoetryMachine, which combined poems from Jon St&aring;le Ritland&rsquo;s BodySearches (2013) with three-dimensional software art by Dutch media artist Michiel Koelink. Successful presentations of BodySearches/PoetryMachine inspired Ritland and Koelink to develop an editor that could write in three dimensions. Prototypes were presented at various festivals, including Poetry International, where poets were invited to compose a new work using the application. Their responses, experiences and critiques were input for subsequent improvements to the application.
        </p>

        <span class="quote">
        "The 3D Poetry Editor opens new possibilities in writing and reading poetry, and also
        opens new room for what a poem might be. It can make you think differently about
        poetry, as in my case, by using molecular forms, and writing poems that I otherwise
        would not have thought of."
        <span class="by">Jon St&aring;le Ritland</span>
        </span>

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p class="col3">
        3D Poetry Editor is developed by the Dutch media artist Michiel Koelink, the Norwegian poet Jon St&aring;le Ritland and the Portuguese programmer David Jonas. The application is created with Unity &ndash; a program for creating 3D-games. 3D Poetry Editor runs on most current platforms (Windows, Apple, Linux), and can also be embedded in websites. Poems written in 3D Poetry Editor are saved as a .3dpff file. 3D Poetry Editor is open source, and is published under a Creative Commons licence. Authors retain the copyright of the poems they write with 3D Poetry Editor.
        <br /><br />
        3D Poetry Editor is made possible thanks to a grant from the Dutch Foundation for Literature.

          <h4>Solving MacOSX installation issues</h4>
          <p>Since the release MacOSX Mojave (10.14), the app gets blocked from creating the 3D poetry files and reading the configuration file that is necessary to run the program.
          This is due to us not being (and not agreeing to be) Identified Apple Developers.
          Fortunately, this security block is very easy to work around and you will be able to create your poems freely. The only thing you need to do is not download the app with your browser.
          </p>
          <p>
          Apps downloaded from the internet with a browser get tagged as unsafe by the operating system. The workaround is to download it through a terminal application called curl. You don't need any special software to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
          All you need to do is open a terminal (press Command+Space, write "terminal" and press the return key), and on the terminal window paste the following command:
          </p>
          <pre>
curl http://www.3dpoetryeditor.art/download/3DPoetryEditor_mac.zip > ~/Downloads/3DPoetryEditor_mac.zip
          </pre>
          <p>
          That's all you need to do. You can now close the terminal and a zip file with the app will be on your Downloads folder.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          You can download the 3D Poetry Editor to view the poems presented at the Poetry International festival and create your own 3D poems from scratch.
          To run the application you only need to uncompress the downloaded file and double-click the executable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can let David and Michiel guide you throught the app on a <a href="https://youtu.be/OULE3WC2kgo">simple video tutorial</a>. The video was made for the pioneer 3D poets testing the application, at the time of the video, the application was an early alpha version and it might look a bit different but the ideas and instructions are still all the same.

        <h1>The gravity of words</h1>
        <p>
          14 poets from all around the world have contributed their 3D poems for the exhibition named <i>"The gravity of words"</i> at Poetry International Festival in Rotterdam. They were first introduced to the 3D Poetry Editor in the 2016 edition of the festival and joined the project as pioneers of 3D poetry. The results of their first explorations are being exhibited in the 2017 edition of the <a href="http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/">Poetry International Festival Rotterdam</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a list of the poems selected for the exhibition. You can download these along with the 3D Poetry Editor app and you can click the titles to view them in video:
